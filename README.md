Abstract

    This small application allows to create and simulate any Deterministic or Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA or NFA) as well as Turing Machines (TM).
    It has been inspired by class CS411 (Automata Theory) taught by Prof. Galles and CS601 (Object-Oriented Software Development) taught by Prof. Parr.
    Written entirely in Java (using Swing for the GUI) 

	
Features

    Creates, simulates and transforms DFA and NFA machines
    Creates and simulates TM
    Batch tests for TM: useful features to test a bunch of files quickly!
    Easy-to-use GUI interface (multi-documents)
    Smart links between objects
    Machines can be drawn using the mouse - and resized at any time
    Multiple machines can be created in a single document
    Multiple documents can be opened at the same time
    Documents can be saved and reloaded from disk
    Debug mode to see exactly how the machine is working (each step has a different color)
    Export any machine to EPS file
    Mac OS X GUI compliant

	
	
##at 2013 , I developed this cool java application and added DFA Minimizer Feature.##
